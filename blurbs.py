latent_blurb = """Latent Lab: Navigating Innovation: Interactive Data Exploration & Inspiration
    Leads: Kevin Dunnell, Andrew Stoddard, Trudy Painter, Andy Lippman
    Latent Lab is an AI-driven, graphical knowledge exploration system. Full text and (soon) media analysis reveal conceptual overlaps between elements at any scale. The interface is designed for exploration rather than search and is intended to inspire a graphical conversation from which new ideas will emerge. A sidebar offers a dedicated space for delving into the specifics of selected data and crafting unique "recipes" by combining multiple documents. Recipes are synthesized as new ideas in real-time for further ideation and refinement by users. Latent Lab includes data from the Media Lab, US Patent Office, tweets on COVID-19, and various user-uploaded datasets. The system creates a 1,536 dimension vector for each dataset that is reduced to 2D and rendered on-screen for visualization and interactive exploration.

newsdive_blurb = """NewsDive: Redefining Interactive News Experience
    Leads: Amani Kiruga, Gauri Agarwal, Andy Lippman
    The plethora of news sources can often come with biases, selective coverage, and even fake narratives. NewsDive offers an AI-driven, dialogue-based news exploration platform, unveiling hidden connections between news stories from different sources. NewsDive hopes to address these challenges by providing users with a robust comparative analysis tool to differentiate and discern between news interpretations. Most crucially, it recognizes the importance of personal data protection, allowing users to explore different news perspectives without compromising on their privacy.

    AI for Creativity in Complex Dynamic Environments
    Neural Notes is an AI companion that improvises jazz with you. The purpose of the AI is to help you become more creative while you are interacting with it in real-time.  We are using Neural Notes as a testbed to design and experiment with neuro-symbolic AI architectures and algorithmic generation methods in a real-time context with complex constraints (in this context: jazz music theory).  The same ideas generalize to real-time operations such as driving operating machinery.

    AI for Decision-Making in Complex Environments
    Leads: Mike Hao Jiang, Andy Lippman
    This project tests AI to improve decision-making in dynamic situations.  Our demonstration is a simulation of wildfire spread.  We combine deep learning to use history with a rapid-response system that reacts to the unexpected.  Users are engaged with the simulation to build better strategies.
